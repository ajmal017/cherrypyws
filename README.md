2) Scrape the 'Nifty 50' table values (from the above URL) every 5 minutes (in the background and on a different thread) and persist in a Redis instance.

3) On the webapp, display the values stored in Redis in a cards layout (unlike the original table). Use valid HTML5 + CSS3 to make the view look nice (eg: http://www.sketchappsources.com/resources/source-image/messages-cards-rahulbhadauria.png)

4) Commit the code to a Github repo, host the app on a free Heroku or AWS instance and submit the details.
